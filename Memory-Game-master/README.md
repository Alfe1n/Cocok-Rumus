### Project Overview: Memory Game

#### Description:
The "Memory Game" project is a graphical, Java-based memory game application where players match pairs of cards within a grid. The game features user-friendly menus, scoring mechanisms, and difficulty levels. This project is implemented using `Swing` for the GUI and adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

### Key Features
1. **Interactive User Interface**
   - Main menu with options for starting a new game, viewing high scores, and exiting.
   - Dynamic board resizing and level selection.
   - A win dialog that shows results and provides an option to save scores.

2. **Scoring System**
   - Points are calculated based on time, attempts, and selected difficulty level.
   - A high scores table that persists between sessions using binary serialization.

3. **Game Timer**
   - Tracks the elapsed time during gameplay.
   - Pauses when the game is paused.

4. **Persistence**
   - High scores are stored in a `scores.bin` file, ensuring scores are retained between game launches.

5. **Levels and Challenges**
   - Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Crazy.
   - Dynamic point calculation for each level.

6. **Polished Design**
   - Custom buttons (`MenuButton`) and labels (`MenuLabel`) for a consistent style.
   - Background images and animations for an immersive experience.

### Technical Highlights
1. **Project Structure**
   - **Packages:**
     - `game`: Core game logic, GUI components for gameplay, and timers.
     - `menu`: Main menu components and navigational controls.
     - `scores`: Scoring logic and table model implementation.
   
2. **Custom GUI Components**
   - `MenuButton` and `MenuLabel` provide uniformity across UI elements.
   - Card components dynamically update based on game state.

3. **Singleton Pattern**
   - `MemoryFrame` ensures only one instance of the game window exists at a time.
   - `ScoreTableModel` provides a single source for managing and retrieving score data.

4. **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**
   - Point calculation adapts to difficulty levels using a strategy implemented in `PointsCalculator`.

5. **Event Handling**
   - Game logic is tightly integrated with Swing’s event listeners for seamless interaction.

6. **Threading**
   - `GameTimer` ensures accurate timekeeping while supporting pause and resume functionality.

### Strengths
- **Modular Design:** Classes and packages are well-organized, making the codebase easy to navigate.
- **Customizability:** Difficulty levels and point calculations can be modified with minimal code changes.
- **Persistence:** High scores are stored persistently using binary serialization.
- **Polished UI:** The use of images, custom components, and layout managers enhances the user experience.

### Potential Improvements
1. **Code Readability**
   - **Action Listeners:** Consider extracting complex anonymous inner classes into separate methods or classes.
   - **Magic Strings:** Replace hard-coded strings (e.g., file paths, "Player") with constants or configuration files.

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for critical components like `ScoreTableModel`, `PointsCalculator`, and `Card` logic.

3. **Persistence Improvements**
   - Switch from binary serialization to JSON or XML for better compatibility and readability of saved data.

4. **Scalability**
   - Implement a feature to dynamically add new levels or themes.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Adjust layouts dynamically for better support across varying screen resolutions.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages in `ScoreTableModel` for cases like file access issues or corrupted save files.

7. **Localization**
   - Support multiple languages by externalizing all text into resource bundles.

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Document the classes and methods using JavaDoc.
2. Refactor code to remove redundancies and improve cohesion.
3. Explore migrating to a modern GUI framework like JavaFX for enhanced visual capabilities.
4. Add animations or effects when cards are flipped for a more engaging user experience.
5. Consider multiplayer or online leaderboard functionality.

### Example Gameplay Flow
1. **Start Game:**
   - Player selects a difficulty level from the menu.
   - The board is initialized with cards shuffled and hidden.

2. **Play Game:**
   - Player clicks on cards to reveal them.
   - Matches are scored, and unmatched cards are hidden again.
   - Timer and attempt counter are updated dynamically.

3. **Win Dialog:**
   - Displays the player’s score and allows saving the result.
   - Provides an option to return to the main menu.

4. **High Scores:**
   - Displays a table of scores sorted by points.
   - Accessible from the main menu.
