#### Description:
4	+
The "Memory Game" project is a graphical, Java-based memory game application where players match pairs of cards within a grid. The game features user-friendly menus, scoring mechanisms, and difficulty levels. This project is implemented using `Swing` for the GUI and adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

### Key Features
9	+
1. **Interactive User Interface**
10	+
   - Main menu with options for starting a new game, viewing high scores, and exiting.
11	+
   - Dynamic board resizing and level selection.
12	+
   - A win dialog that shows results and provides an option to save scores.
13	+
14	+
2. **Scoring System**
15	+
   - Points are calculated based on time, attempts, and selected difficulty level.
16	+
   - A high scores table that persists between sessions using binary serialization.
17	+
18	+
3. **Game Timer**
19	+
   - Tracks the elapsed time during gameplay.
20	+
   - Pauses when the game is paused.
21	+
22	+
4. **Persistence**
23	+
   - High scores are stored in a `scores.bin` file, ensuring scores are retained between game launches.
24	+
25	+
5. **Levels and Challenges**
26	+
   - Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Crazy.
27	+
   - Dynamic point calculation for each level.
28	+
29	+
6. **Polished Design**
30	+
   - Custom buttons (`MenuButton`) and labels (`MenuLabel`) for a consistent style.
31	+
   - Background images and animations for an immersive experience.

### Technical Highlights
36	+
1. **Project Structure**
37	+
   - **Packages:**
38	+
     - `game`: Core game logic, GUI components for gameplay, and timers.
39	+
     - `menu`: Main menu components and navigational controls.
40	+
     - `scores`: Scoring logic and table model implementation.
41	+
   
42	+
2. **Custom GUI Components**
43	+
   - `MenuButton` and `MenuLabel` provide uniformity across UI elements.
44	+
   - Card components dynamically update based on game state.
45	+
46	+
3. **Singleton Pattern**
47	+
   - `MemoryFrame` ensures only one instance of the game window exists at a time.
48	+
   - `ScoreTableModel` provides a single source for managing and retrieving score data.
49	+
50	+
4. **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**
51	+
   - Point calculation adapts to difficulty levels using a strategy implemented in `PointsCalculator`.
52	+
53	+
5. **Event Handling**
54	+
   - Game logic is tightly integrated with Swing’s event listeners for seamless interaction.
55	+
56	+
6. **Threading**
57	+
   - `GameTimer` ensures accurate timekeeping while supporting pause and resume functionality.

### Strengths
62	+
- **Modular Design:** Classes and packages are well-organized, making the codebase easy to navigate.
63	+
- **Customizability:** Difficulty levels and point calculations can be modified with minimal code changes.
64	+
- **Persistence:** High scores are stored persistently using binary serialization.
65	+
- **Polished UI:** The use of images, custom components, and layout managers enhances the user experience.

### Potential Improvements
70	+
1. **Code Readability**
71	+
   - **Action Listeners:** Consider extracting complex anonymous inner classes into separate methods or classes.
72	+
   - **Magic Strings:** Replace hard-coded strings (e.g., file paths, "Player") with constants or configuration files.
73	+
74	+
2. **Testing**
75	+
   - Add unit tests for critical components like `ScoreTableModel`, `PointsCalculator`, and `Card` logic.
76	+
77	+
3. **Persistence Improvements**
78	+
   - Switch from binary serialization to JSON or XML for better compatibility and readability of saved data.
79	+
80	+
4. **Scalability**
81	+
   - Implement a feature to dynamically add new levels or themes.
82	+
83	+
5. **Responsive Design**
84	+
   - Adjust layouts dynamically for better support across varying screen resolutions.
85	+
86	+
6. **Error Handling**
87	+
   - Improve error messages in `ScoreTableModel` for cases like file access issues or corrupted save files.
88	+
89	+
7. **Localization**
90	+
   - Support multiple languages by externalizing all text into resource bundles.

### Suggested Next Steps
95	+
1. Document the classes and methods using JavaDoc.
96	+
2. Refactor code to remove redundancies and improve cohesion.
97	+
3. Explore migrating to a modern GUI framework like JavaFX for enhanced visual capabilities.
98	+
4. Add animations or effects when cards are flipped for a more engaging user experience.
99	+
5. Consider multiplayer or online leaderboard functionality.

### Example Gameplay Flow
104	+
1. **Start Game:**
105	+
   - Player selects a difficulty level from the menu.
106	+
   - The board is initialized with cards shuffled and hidden.
107	+
108	+
2. **Play Game:**
109	+
   - Player clicks on cards to reveal them.
110	+
   - Matches are scored, and unmatched cards are hidden again.
111	+
   - Timer and attempt counter are updated dynamically.
112	+
113	+
3. **Win Dialog:**
114	+
   - Displays the player’s score and allows saving the result.
115	+
   - Provides an option to return to the main menu.
116	+
117	+
4. **High Scores:**
118	+
   - Displays a table of scores sorted by points.
119	+
   - Accessible from the main menu.
